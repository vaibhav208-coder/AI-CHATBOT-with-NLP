# AI-CHATBOT-with-NLP
Name: Vaibhav Dubey Intern ID :CT04DL1273 DOMAIN:python programming DURATION: 4 WEEKS MENTOR:Neela santosh Kumar Project Title: AI Chatbot Using NLP in Python

Project Description:

This project involves building a simple AI chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries such as NLTK or spaCy in Python. The chatbot can understand basic user input, process natural language, and provide relevant responses. It’s designed for handling predefined questions or FAQs through keyword or similarity-based matching.

Objective:

The goal is to demonstrate how NLP can be used to create an intelligent, interactive chatbot. The bot will analyze user input, identify intent, and return appropriate replies using a basic rule-based or retrieval-based method.

How It Works:

Data Setup: A small dataset of common questions and answers is created (or loaded from a file).

Text Processing: The chatbot uses NLP techniques like tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.

Matching Logic: With TF-IDF and cosine similarity, it finds the best match for a user’s query.

Response: The matched answer is returned; if no match is found, a fallback response is used.

Tools Used:

Python

NLTK or spaCy

Scikit-learn (for TF-IDF)

Optionally: Streamlit or Flask for a simple web interface

Deliverables:

Python script with chatbot logic

Sample Q&A dataset

Working chatbot via terminal or web interface

OUTPUT:
